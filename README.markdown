# Duplicate Profile

* Version: 1.0
* Author: Nick Dunn <http://github.com/nickdunn/>
* Build Date: 2009-09-23
* Requirements: Symphony 2.0.2

## Installation

1. Download and upload the 'duplicate_entry' folder to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable the extension by selecting "Duplicate Entry" in the list and choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

## Usage

When viewing an entry's "edit" form you will see a "Save as New" button. Submitting the form using this button will save changes to a brand new entry.

## Todo
* Make the button translatable
* Fix bug whereby validation errors render the form back in "new" mode (potentially unfixable)
